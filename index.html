                <p>Right now,  I’ve been diving into digital illustration and learning how to create detailed artwork on the computer, which has been really exciting. On top of that, I’m experimenting with animation, trying out new techniques to make my illustrations move and bring them to life. I'm also doing web designing as part of my course right now, and I can say that it is a little bit challenging for me but I think I'm enjoying it somehow. I love how multimedia allows me to mix creative elements and push boundaries. There's always something new to learn, and it keeps things fresh and exciting every day.</p>
